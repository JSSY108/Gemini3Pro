Evidence Breakdown:**\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second.\n*   The exact value defined by the International System of Units (SI) is 299,792.458 meters per second.\n*   Light travels at different speeds depending on the medium through which it travels.\n\n**3. Context & Nuance:**\nWhile the approximation of 300,000 km/s is commonly used, the exact speed of light in a vacuum is 299,792.458 km/s. The claim is mostly true because it provides a rounded value. The variance depends on the medium through which light travels, with the maximum speed achieved in a vacuum.\n\n**4. Red Flags & Discrepancies:**\nNo major discrepancies found in the verified sources.",

      "snippet": "In 1983, more than 300 years after the first serious measurement attempt, the speed of light was defined as being 299,792.458 kilometers per second by the Seventeenth General Congress on Weights and Measures. Thus, the meter is defined as the distance light travels during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 seconds. In general, however, (even in many scientific calculations) the speed of light is rounded to 300,000 kilometers (or 186,000 miles) per second."

      "snippet": "(2023-05-30) Light moves at an incredible 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second), equivalent to almost 700 million mph (more than 1 billion km/h). That&#39;s fast enough to circumnavigate the globe 7.5 times in one second, while a typical passenger jet would take more than two days to go around once (and that doesn&#39;t include stops for fuel or layovers!). ... Light moves so fast that, for much of human history, we thought it traveled instantaneously. As early as the late 1600s, though, scientist Ole Roemer was able to measure the speed of light (usually referred to as c) by using observations of Jupiter&#39;s moons, according to Britannica."

It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1\u2044299792458 second.
