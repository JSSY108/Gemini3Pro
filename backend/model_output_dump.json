Evidence Breakdown:**\n*   The concept of a flat Earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven idea.\n*   Ancient Greek mathematicians discovered evidence that the Earth is a sphere around 500 BCE.\n*   By about 330 BC, Aristotle had provided strong empirical evidence for a spherical Earth.\n*   Ferdinand Magellan's crew confirmed the spherical shape of Earth in the 16th century when they became the first to circumnavigate the globe.\n\n**3. Context & Nuance:**\nThe belief in a flat Earth is a conspiracy theory that persists despite scientific evidence to the contrary. The Earth is actually an ellipsoid due to its rotation.\n\n**4. Red Flags & Discrepancies:**\nNo major discrepancies found in the verified sources.",

Flat Earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient societies subscribed to a flat-Earth cosmography.\n... ... Pythagoras in the 6th century BC and Parmenides in the 5th century BC stated that the Earth is spherical, and this view spread rapidly in the Greek world. Around 330 BC, Aristotle maintained on the basis of physical theory and observational evidence that the Earth was spherical, and reported an estimate of its circumference."

      "snippet": "While the Earth may not be a perfect sphere, the important thing to remember here is that the Earth is NOT! FLAT! But\u2026how did we figure that out? In ancient Greece, the philosopher Aristotle was one of the first people to theorize that our planet was round. He figured this out with the help of the solar system. He observed that the Earth has a round shadow during a lunar eclipse and concluded that the shape of the planet must also be a sphere. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan's crew tangibly confirmed the spherical shape in the 16th century, when they became the first to circumnavigate the globe."
