Evidence Breakdown:**\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792.458 kilometers per second.\n*   The speed of light is a universal physical constant.\n*   The speed of light is used to define the meter.\n\n**3. Context & Nuance:**\nWhile 300,000 km/s is a common approximation, the exact value is 299,792.458 km/s. The claim is close, but not entirely accurate. The difference, while seemingly small, is significant in precise scientific calculations.\n\n**4. Red Flags & Discrepancies:**\nNo major discrepancies found in the verified sources.",

That&#39;s fast enough to circumnavigate the globe 7.5 times in one second, while a typical passenger jet would take more than two days to go around once (and that doesn&#39;t include stops for fuel or layovers!). ... Light moves so fast that, for much of human history, we thought it traveled instantaneously. As early as the late 1600s, though, scientist Ole Roemer was able to measure the speed of light (usually referred to as c) by using observations of Jupiter&#39;s moons, according to Britannica.\n... Nowadays, the speed of light is used to define units of length, so its value is fixed; humans have essentially agreed the speed of light is 299,792.458 kilometers per second, exactly."
