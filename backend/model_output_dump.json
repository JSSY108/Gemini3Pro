Evidence Breakdown:**\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second.\n*   The exact value defined by the International System of Units (SI) is 299,792.458 meters per second.\n*   Rounding this value often results in the approximation of 300,000 kilometers per second.\n\n**3. Context & Nuance:**\nWhile the speed of light is often approximated as 300,000 km/s, the exact value is 299,792.458 km/s. The claim is mostly true because it uses a common approximation. The difference between the approximation and the actual value is small.\n\n**4. Red Flags & Discrepancies:**\nNo major discrepancies found in the verified sources.",

Due to its finite speed, sunlight takes 8 minutes and 10 to 27 seconds to reach Earth, depending on the time of year.\n\nThe speed of light in vacuum, often called simply the speed of light and commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant exactly equal to 299792458 m\u22c5s\u22121. It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1\u2044299792458 second.
