Evidence Breakdown:**\n*   Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level under standard atmospheric pressure.\n*   The boiling point of water changes with altitude and pressure. At higher altitudes, where atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at a lower temperature.\n*   Impurities in the water can also affect its boiling point.\n\n**3. Context & Nuance:**\nThe statement is generally true under standard conditions (sea level, standard atmospheric pressure). However, it's important to note that the boiling point of water is not a fixed value and can vary depending on environmental factors such as altitude and pressure. The claim is mostly true because it doesn't specify the conditions under which water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.\n\n**4. Red Flags & Discrepancies:**\nNo major discrepancies found in the verified sources.",
