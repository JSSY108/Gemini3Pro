Evidence Breakdown:**\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is a universal physical constant.\n*   The exact value is 299,792,458 meters per second.\n*   This is equivalent to approximately 299,792.458 kilometers per second.\n*   The approximate value of 300,000 kilometers per second is often used.\n\n**3. Context & Nuance:**\nWhile 300,000 km/s is a common approximation, the *exact* speed of light is 299,792.458 km/s. The claim is technically incorrect due to the rounding. The difference, while seemingly small, is significant in precise scientific calculations.\n\n**4. Red Flags & Discrepancies:**\nNo major discrepancies found in the verified sources.",
